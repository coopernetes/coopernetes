Hiya, my name is Tom! I orchestrate computers to do things (usually with other computers) for a living.
I'm passionate about software development, open technology & social justice, music,
video games, art, nature, language and history.

- Specialize in DevOps, platform engineering & full-stack development.
- Former network engineer, Java developer & cloud architect. Quite literally up and down the stack.
- Currently leading the Open Source Program Office & building our internal developer platform on [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) at Royal Bank of Canada.
