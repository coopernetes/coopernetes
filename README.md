Howdy y'all! I'm Tom - I write some code, have plenty of opinions and fiddle with computers for a living.
I have a healthy amount of experience with TCP/IP, REST APIs, Linux, infrastructure, DevOps, containers 
and cloud. Currently leading the Open Source Program Office at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, Canada.

I'm not really active on the socials except for posting at [Hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io) on <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@coopernetes">Mastodon</a>.
