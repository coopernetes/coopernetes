Howdy y'all! I'm Tom, I write some code, have plenty of opinions and fiddle with computers for a living.
I have a good amount of experience with TCP/IP, APIs, Linux, config management,
DevOps, containers and cloud. Currently leading a small dev team in the OSPO at a major bank in Toronto, Canada.

I'm not really active on the socials except for posting at [Hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io) on <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@coopernetes">Mastodon</a>.

Big shout out to [@krisnova](https://github.com/krisnova) and the hachyderm infra & mod crew ♥️
